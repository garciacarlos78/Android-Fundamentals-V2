Codelabs from *Android Developer Fundamentals (Version 2)* - Unit 2 (User experience) - Lesson 5

## 5.1 - Drawables, styles, and themes (scoreKeeper)

Codelab from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-drawables-styles-and-themes/#0.

Create an app to maintain a score for two teams, with buttons for increasing and decreasing the score of each team.

 ### Key points
   - ShapeDrawable.
   - Create style and apply them to multiple `View` elements and layouts.
   - Style inheritance:
     - Child style inherints all of the parent's attributes
     - Style attributes defined in both parent and child uses child's definition (that's, child overrides parent)
     - Child style can include additional attributes that the parent doesn't define
   - Theme: style that's applied to an entire `Activity` or app.
   - Theme for night: `DayNight` theme.
