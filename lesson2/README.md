[Related codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-create-an-activity/#0).

Create an activity that launches a second activity.

### Goals
  - Use of `parentActivityName` attribute to indicate parent-child activity relationship (*Up navigation*).
  - Use of `meta-data` to define parent-child relationship for APIs earlier to 16.
  - User of `Bundle` to send data between aplications.

### Learned concepts
  - `android:label` in manifest.xml adds the Activity's title to the app bar.
  - `android:visibility="invisible"`: make initially invisible the view where applied.
